## F.R.I.D.A.Y - Functional Responsive Intelligent Digital Assistant for You ##

The F.R.I.D.A.Y. repository is an open-source project that provides a Functional Responsive Intelligent Digital Assistant for You. It is designed to serve as a personal assistant, integrating various APIs to make your linux box smarter with the power of ai, automation and voice interaction. 

Functional Responsive Intelligent Digital Assistant for You
A hybrid AI-powered assistant for Linux with privacy, speed, and real utility.

‚∏ª

What is F.R.I.D.A.Y.?

F.R.I.D.A.Y. is a personal AI assistant for Linux built from the ground up to be privacy-first, modular, and capable of running on low-power devices like old PCs and Raspberry Pi. It‚Äôs designed to bridge the gap between cloud-based language models and real-world, local system control.

Built in just 2 weeks as a passion project, F.R.I.D.A.Y. combines voice interaction, real-time system automation, and intelligent command execution ‚Äî without sacrificing your control or privacy.

‚∏ª

Key Features
	‚Ä¢	Voice Commands
Natural language voice interaction using microphone input and audio feedback.
	‚Ä¢	Groq-powered NLP
Fast, cost-free cloud inference using Groq for language understanding and intent parsing.
	‚Ä¢	Windsurf AI (local)
Local code generation and execution using Windsurf, enabling system control, shell commands, and file manipulation.
	‚Ä¢	Modular Architecture
Decoupled cloud + local processing ‚Äî cloud LLMs handle language, while local scripts handle real-time execution and device control.
	‚Ä¢	Google Integration
Send emails, read your calendar, and access user-specific data securely.
	‚Ä¢	YouTube Music & Smart Home Control
Manage media and connected devices directly through voice.
	‚Ä¢	Low-resource Compatible
Works on older machines ‚Äî no GPU or local LLM needed. Can run on Raspberry Pi and similar devices.
	‚Ä¢	Privacy-First
Only language parsing touches the cloud. All execution and sensitive data handling remains local.

‚∏ª

Why It‚Äôs Different

Unlike typical AI assistants tied to Big Tech, F.R.I.D.A.Y. gives you real ownership, customization, and offline power. It‚Äôs designed for hackers, makers, and privacy advocates who want a voice assistant that actually works ‚Äî without spying on them or eating system resources.

‚∏ª

Planned/Optional Add-ons
	‚Ä¢	Offline fallback mode (minimal keyword + STT)
	‚Ä¢	GUI configuration panel
	‚Ä¢	Home Assistant or MQTT integration
	‚Ä¢	Custom trigger phrases and wakeword engine

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview of F.R.I.D.A.Y.

F.R.I.D.A.Y. (Functional Responsive Intelligent Digital Assistant for You) is a privacy-focused, modular AI assistant designed for Linux systems, optimized for low-resource devices. It seamlessly integrates cloud-based NLP with local execution to provide a responsive and secure user experience.

üîß Architecture & Components
	‚Ä¢	Voice Interaction: Utilizes microphone input for voice commands, enabling hands-free operation.
	‚Ä¢	Natural Language Processing (NLP): Employs Groq AI for fast, cloud-based intent recognition, allowing natural language understanding without the need for local LLMs.
	‚Ä¢	Local Code Generation: Leverages Windsurf AI to generate and execute shell scripts locally, facilitating real-time system control and automation.
	‚Ä¢	Modular Design: Features a decoupled architecture separating cloud-based language parsing from local command execution, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

üîê Privacy & Efficiency
	‚Ä¢	Privacy-First Approach: Only the NLP component interacts with the cloud; all sensitive operations, including email and calendar access, are handled locally.
	‚Ä¢	Resource Optimization: Designed to run efficiently on low-power hardware such as Raspberry Pi or legacy PCs, eliminating the need for high-end servers.

üß© Extensibility
	‚Ä¢	Custom Triggers: Supports user-defined triggers via scripts like windsurf_trigger.sh, allowing personalized automation workflows.
	‚Ä¢	Smart Device Control: Capable of managing smart home devices, integrating seamlessly with existing ecosystems.
	‚Ä¢	Google Account Integration: Connects to Google services for sending emails and accessing calendar events, providing user-specific information.

üöÄ Installation

Follow these steps to install F.R.I.D.A.Y. on your Linux system:
1. Download Release File

Download the latest release: https://github.com/B3ND1X/F.R.I.D.A.Y./releases
and unzip the file. 

2. Ensure You Have Your Google Credentials

Before proceeding, you'll need a credentials.json file from your Google Cloud Console:

    Visit Google Cloud Console

    Create a new project (or select an existing one)

    Enable Gmail API and Google Calendar API

    Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID for "Desktop App"

    Download the JSON and rename it to credentials.json

    Place it in the root directory of this project

3. Run the Installer Script

Run the following command as root (using sudo) to install all required dependencies:
sudo chmod +x install.sh 

sudo ./install.sh


This script will:

    Check for system requirements

    Install Node.js, npm, and system tools

    Install required npm packages (e.g., Express, Axios, Google APIs)

    Prompt for your API keys (Groq, Weather, News, TMDB, Spotify)

    Set up permissions and configuration

4. Launch the Assistant

After installation, you can start the assistant with:

./start.sh start| stop | debug


or 

 ./run.sh

*as non sudo user**

Then visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to begin using F.R.I.D.A.Y.

*For best results use chrome, other browsers like brave or firefox seem to either block the mic or STT* 

### üó£Ô∏èüéôÔ∏è **VOICE COMMANDS:** ###
## All voice commands require a wake word to trigger. The assistant starts listening when you say "Hey Friday." ##

### ü§ñ **Fallback AI (Groq Integration)**
If a command doesn‚Äôt match any of the above, it will be passed to your Groq-based assistant for a smart response or conversation.
---

‚úÖ **All spoken and text responses are auto-handled!**  
NLP integrated so you can just talk to it naturally.


**PLEASE NOTE FOR ALL SYSTEM RELATED COMMANDS REQUIRE A BACKEND SERVER RUNNING LOCALLY**
This would mean stuff like changing volume, rebooting, etc. Anything that needs access to your device or system would need to have a node server backend running local!!


### üîê **Privacy and Data**

‚∏ª

Privacy Disclosure

This project includes voice interaction features using the Web Speech API, which enables speech recognition and speech synthesis in supported browsers.

Features Used
	‚Ä¢	Speech Synthesis (TTS): Converts text into spoken voice output using your device‚Äôs built-in speech engine.
	‚Ä¢	Speech Recognition (STT): Converts spoken input into text for interaction.

Data Handling and Privacy
	‚Ä¢	No voice data is collected, stored, or transmitted by this application.
	‚Ä¢	Microphone access is only initiated with your explicit permission via your browser.
	‚Ä¢	Speech Synthesis is processed locally on your device using system-provided voices.
	‚Ä¢	Speech Recognition may be processed either locally or by third-party servers, depending on your browser:
	‚Ä¢	In Safari, STT may use Apple servers.
	‚Ä¢	In Chrome, STT typically uses Google‚Äôs cloud services.
	‚Ä¢	Some browsers (e.g., WebKitGTK) may support fully local recognition.

Please refer to your browser‚Äôs privacy policy for further information on how voice data is handled during speech recognition:
	‚Ä¢	Apple Privacy Policy
	‚Ä¢	Google Privacy Policy

### Groq AI Usage

This project utilizes Groq AI for language processing tasks (e.g., speech-to-text or text analysis).

- **No user data is stored or logged** by this application.
- All communication with Groq services is subject to Groq Inc.'s data handling policies.
- To learn more, please refer to the [Groq Privacy Policy](https://groq.com/privacy-policy).

Note: If you are using a third-party wrapper or API provider that runs on Groq hardware, please review their respective privacy terms as well.

If you are concerned about speech data being transmitted to third parties, we recommend using a browser that supports local speech recognition and or modifying the code to use a local LLM.
